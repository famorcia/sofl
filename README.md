[![Continuous Integration Build](https://github.com/famorcia/sofl/actions/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/famorcia/sofl/actions/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml)

# SoFl
Coin GUI binding for FLTK

# Limitations
- Only Ubuntu Linux tested
- Open Inventor requires GL context to be managed independently of FLTK, so for having widget over the GL context,
it is required an extension of SoFlRenderArea (to be done)
